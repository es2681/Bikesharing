# Bikesharing
## Overview:
The purpose of the project was to analyze and extrapolate citibike data from New York City collected in August 2019 so that it can be applied to establishing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA.

## Results:
- In August 2019, 2,344,244 riders used citibikes in NYC. Approximately 65% of those riders were male and 25% were female. The gender of 10% is unknown. Ridership is highest between 8 and 10 am as well as 4 and 8 pm. Ridership is lowest between 12 and 6 am.
- Between 12 and 3 am, trip duration is longest shortly after midnight after which there is a steep drop-off in ridership. Males are the majority of riders during this time.
- Ridership is higher on weekdays between 7 and 10 am and 5 and 8 pm. On weekends, ridership is consistently high between the late morning through the afternoon and early evening. Males are the primary citibike users during these times.
- The majority of citibike users are male and have a citibike subcription. 

## Summary:
The majority of citibike users are male, and a large portion of users appear to be commuters on their way to or from work. To bring a citibike model to Des Moines, it would be helpful to place citibike stations in downtown or other high commercial areas as well as heavily residential neighborhoods for commuter use. Also, it would be helpful to investigate the presence of bike lanes in Des Moines, such as locations, condition, location in reference to safety and high traffic/highway areas, etc. It is possible that there are fewer female riders in NYC due to safety concerns. Adding new bike lanes and implementing safety improvements to existing lanes may increase the number of female riders and help develop a stronger program in Des Moines.
